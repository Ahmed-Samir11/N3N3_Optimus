# DQN Training Strategy for Multi-Scenario VRP

## Current Results Analysis (Solver 69)

### Strong Performance ✅
- **Scenario 1** (18 orders): 100% fulfillment, $918 cost
- **Scenario 2** (30 orders): 100% fulfillment, $1,584 cost
- **Scenario 5** (49 orders): 98% fulfillment, $4,613 cost
- **Scenario 6** (34 orders): 97% fulfillment, $5,427 cost

### Weak Performance ❌
- **Scenario 4** (unknown orders): **11% fulfillment** (3 orders), $422 cost
- **Scenario 3** (unknown orders): **0% fulfillment**, $0 cost

## Root Cause: Training Data Mismatch

### Current DQN Training
Your DQN was likely trained on environments with:
- **Fixed order count**: Exactly 50 orders
- **Specific capacity constraints**: Matching training scenarios
- **Specific spatial distributions**: Limited diversity

### State Feature Scaling Issue
The DQN uses normalized state features:
```python
fulfillment = len(assigned_orders) / total_orders  # 3/27 vs 25/50
remaining_fraction = (total_orders - assigned) / total_orders
```

**Problem**: When `total_orders` changes dramatically (27 vs 50), the state space shifts and the DQN makes poor predictions.

## Solution: Multi-Scenario Training

### Training Strategy

#### Phase 1: Small Scenarios (Episodes 1-100)
- **Order count**: 10-20 orders
- **Purpose**: Learn basic assignment patterns
- **Focus**: Capacity management, simple routing

#### Phase 2: Medium Scenarios (Episodes 101-300)
- **Order count**: 20-40 orders
- **Purpose**: Learn resource allocation tradeoffs
- **Focus**: Multi-warehouse coordination

#### Phase 3: Large Scenarios (Episodes 301-500)
- **Order count**: 30-50 orders
- **Purpose**: Learn complex optimization
- **Focus**: Long-term planning, vehicle utilization

### Curriculum Learning
Progress from simple to complex:

1. **Level 1**: Single warehouse, unlimited capacity
2. **Level 2**: Multiple warehouses, generous capacity
3. **Level 3**: Tight capacity constraints (like Scenario 4)
4. **Level 4**: Limited inventory per warehouse
5. **Level 5**: Full complexity (Scenario 5-6 level)

### State Feature Improvements

Instead of normalizing by total orders, use **absolute metrics**:

```python
# BEFORE (bad for multi-scenario):
fulfillment = assigned / total_orders  # Changes scale with scenario size

# AFTER (good for multi-scenario):
state = [
    assigned / 50,  # Normalize to max expected (50 orders)
    min(assigned / 10, 1.0),  # Minimum progress indicator
    avg_vehicle_utilization,  # 0-1 scale (independent of order count)
    warehouse_inventory_ratio,  # 0-1 scale
    avg_distance_remaining  # Normalized by max road network distance
]
```

### Reward Shaping

Current reward likely focuses on cost minimization. For competition, prioritize fulfillment:

```python
def compute_reward(state, action, next_state):
    """Reward function prioritizing fulfillment"""
    
    # Base reward: fulfillment progress
    fulfillment_delta = next_state.assigned - state.assigned
    reward = fulfillment_delta * 100  # Large positive for each order fulfilled
    
    # Penalty: cost increase (but much smaller weight)
    cost_delta = next_state.cost - state.cost
    reward -= cost_delta * 0.01  # Small penalty for cost
    
    # Bonus: efficient capacity utilization
    capacity_util = next_state.avg_capacity_utilization
    if capacity_util > 0.7:  # Good utilization
        reward += 10
    
    # Penalty: leaving orders unfulfilled at end
    if next_state.done:
        unfulfilled = next_state.total_orders - next_state.assigned
        reward -= unfulfilled * 200  # HUGE penalty for missing orders
    
    return reward
```

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Setup Custom Environment
Create `rl_custom_env.py` that can generate scenarios with:
- Variable order counts (10-50)
- Variable capacity constraints
- Variable inventory levels
- Random spatial distributions

### Step 2: Train Multi-Scenario DQN
Use the provided `train_dqn_multi_scenario.py`:

```powershell
# Activate environment
& c:/Users/ahmed/OneDrive/Desktop/Beltone/N3N3_Optimus/optimus/Scripts/Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies if needed
pip install networkx numpy

# Run training (500 episodes, ~2-4 hours)
python train_dqn_multi_scenario.py
```

### Step 3: Extract and Embed Weights
After training, extract weights:

```python
import json
import numpy as np

# Load trained model
with open('dqn_multi_scenario_best.json', 'r') as f:
    model_data = json.load(f)

# Convert to Python lists for embedding
weights = model_data['weights']
biases = model_data['biases']

# Create solver with embedded weights
print("PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS = [")
for w in weights:
    print(f"    {w},")
print("]")

print("\nPRETRAINED_BIASES = [")
for b in biases:
    print(f"    {b},")
print("]")
```

### Step 4: Test on All Scenarios
Test the new model:

```powershell
# Test new solver
python -c "from robin_logistics import LogisticsEnvironment; from Ne3Na3_solver_71 import solver; env = LogisticsEnvironment(); result = solver(env); print(env.execute_solution(result))"
```

## Expected Improvements

### Before (Current Solver 69):
- Scenario 4: 11% fulfillment
- Scenario 3: 0% fulfillment

### After (Multi-Scenario Training):
- Scenario 4: 80-90% fulfillment (realistic target)
- Scenario 3: 70-90% fulfillment (depends on scenario characteristics)
- Scenarios 1,2,5,6: Maintain or improve current performance

## Alternative: Hybrid Approach

If training time is limited, use **Solver 71** which combines:
1. **DQN guidance** for initial assignments (when confident)
2. **Greedy fallback** for remaining orders (guarantees fulfillment)

This gives you the best of both worlds:
- DQN optimizes cost when conditions match training
- Greedy ensures maximum fulfillment on all scenarios

## Debugging Scenario 3 & 4

To understand why these scenarios fail, we need to investigate:

### For Scenario 3 (0% fulfillment):
Possible causes:
- Graph connectivity issue (some nodes unreachable?)
- Extreme capacity constraints (no vehicle can fit any order?)
- Inventory shortage (warehouses empty?)
- Bug in solver logic

**Action**: Add logging to see what's happening:
```python
print(f"Total orders: {len(env.get_all_order_ids())}")
print(f"Total vehicles: {len(env.get_all_vehicles())}")
for wh_id, wh in env.warehouses.items():
    print(f"Warehouse {wh_id} inventory: {env.get_warehouse_inventory(wh_id)}")
```

### For Scenario 4 (11% fulfillment):
Likely causes:
- Tight capacity constraints (only 3/27 orders fit)
- Limited inventory distribution (need multi-warehouse splitting)
- Suboptimal vehicle-order matching

**Action**: Use **Solver 71** which has better fallback logic

## Competition Strategy

For maximum points:

1. **Submit Solver 71** (improved DQN + greedy fallback)
   - Better handling of edge cases
   - Guaranteed fallback for difficult scenarios

2. **Train Multi-Scenario DQN** (if you have time)
   - Run `train_dqn_multi_scenario.py` overnight
   - Extract weights and create Solver 72

3. **Keep Solver 69** as backup
   - Still works great on 4/6 scenarios
   - Good cost optimization

4. **Analyze Scenario 3 & 4**
   - Add logging to understand failure modes
   - Create scenario-specific fixes if needed

## Next Steps

**Immediate** (10 minutes):
1. Test Solver 71 on your local environment
2. If it works, submit to competition

**Short-term** (2-4 hours):
1. Set up custom environment for training
2. Run multi-scenario training
3. Create Solver 72 with new weights

**Long-term** (optional):
1. Analyze competition results to understand Scenario 3 & 4
2. Fine-tune DQN architecture (more hidden layers? different activation?)
3. Experiment with other RL algorithms (PPO, A3C, etc.)
