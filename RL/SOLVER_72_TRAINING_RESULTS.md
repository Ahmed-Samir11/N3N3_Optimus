# Training Results Summary - Solver 72

## Training Performance ‚úÖ

### Curriculum Learning Success
The improved training with experience replay and curriculum learning achieved:

| Stage | Episodes | Order Range | Avg Fulfillment | Avg Reward |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Small** | 1-150 | 10-20 orders | **100.0%** ‚úÖ | 1,313 |
| **Medium** | 151-350 | 20-35 orders | **99.6%** ‚úÖ | 2,206 |
| **Large** | 351+ | 35-50 orders | **100.0%** ‚úÖ | 3,120 |

**Early stopping triggered at Episode 350** due to excellent performance (99.5% avg).

### Key Improvements Over First Training
| Metric | First Training | Improved Training |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Episode 50 | 78% ‚Üí declining | **100% maintained** |
| Episode 150 | 53% (catastrophic forgetting) | **100% maintained** |
| Episode 300 | 28% (severe degradation) | **99.7% maintained** |
| Final | 19% fulfillment | **99.6% fulfillment** |

## Test Results on Robin Environment ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Local Test (Default 50-order scenario)
- **Solver 69** (original): 48/50 (96.0%), Cost $4,186
- **Solver 72** (improved): 47/50 (94.0%), Cost $6,886

**Observation**: Solver 72 performs slightly worse on the default test.

### Why The Discrepancy?

The **simulation environment** used for training is simplified:
- Random order sizes (0.05-0.25 capacity)
- No real road network constraints
- Simplified reward structure
- No multi-warehouse inventory constraints

The **real Robin environment** has:
- Complex road network with pathfinding
- Exact warehouse locations and inventory
- Real vehicle capacities and costs
- Multi-SKU order requirements

## Competition Strategy üéØ

### Scenario 4 & 3 Hypothesis
Solver 72 was trained on **variable order counts** (10-50), while Solver 69 was trained on **exactly 50 orders**.

Your competition results showed:
- **Scenario 4**: 11% fulfillment (Solver 69)
- **Scenario 3**: 0% fulfillment (Solver 69)

**Hypothesis**: These scenarios may have different order counts or tighter constraints. Solver 72's curriculum training might handle them better!

### Recommendation

**Submit BOTH solvers to competition:**

1. **Solver 69**: Best for Scenarios 1, 2, 5, 6 (already proven)
   - 100% on Scenarios 1, 2
   - 97-98% on Scenarios 5, 6

2. **Solver 72**: Potentially better for Scenarios 3, 4
   - Trained on variable order counts (10-50)
   - Experience replay prevents forgetting
   - May handle tight constraints better

### Competition Submission
```
Solver 69 ‚Üí Primary submission (proven performance)
Solver 72 ‚Üí Secondary submission (test on Scenario 3 & 4)
```

## Technical Achievements ‚úÖ

### Training Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Experience replay buffer (10,000 capacity)
- ‚úÖ Curriculum learning with 3 stages
- ‚úÖ Gradient clipping (prevents explosion)
- ‚úÖ Adaptive learning rate decay
- ‚úÖ Per-scenario performance tracking
- ‚úÖ Early stopping at 99.5% avg

### Model Architecture
- State size: 5 features (fulfillment, capacity, vehicles, remaining)
- Hidden layers: [128, 64, 32]
- Action size: 100
- Activation: ReLU
- Final epsilon: 0.951 (high exploration retained)
- Final LR: 0.000995

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Competition Deadline)
1. ‚úÖ Submit Solver 69 (proven performer)
2. ‚úÖ Submit Solver 72 (test on Scenarios 3 & 4)
3. Wait for competition results

### Post-Competition (If Time Allows)
1. **Train on Real Environment**: Use actual `robin_logistics` environment instead of simulation
2. **Scenario-Specific Models**: Train separate DQNs for small/medium/large scenarios
3. **Ensemble Approach**: Combine multiple DQN predictions
4. **Hybrid RL + Heuristics**: Use DQN for order selection, greedy for routing

- ‚úÖ Better training stability (no catastrophic forgetting)
- ‚úÖ Exposure to diverse scenario sizes (10-50 orders)
- ‚úÖ Experience replay (retains learning)

**The real test will be competition results on Scenarios 3 & 4!** üéØ
