"""
Helpers to solve a dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel using Qiskit's QAOA
Supports: local simulator (Aer) and IBM Quantum (qiskit-ibm-runtime) when configured.

Important: This module does NOT read or store API keys. Configure your IBM token locally
using Qiskit's recommended methods (see README). NEVER paste tokens into chat.

Usage (high level):
  - Convert your dimod.BQM to a Qiskit QuadraticProgram
  - Instantiate a QAOA optimizer using a Sampler primitive
  - Solve the problem and return assignment and objective value

This is a best-effort integration; real-hardware runs are noisy and limited in qubit count.
Keep your QUBO small (<=20 qubits recommended) for hardware tests.
