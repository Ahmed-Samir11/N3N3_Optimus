Ne3Na3 Solver 50 - AGGRESSIVE COST MINIMIZATION
==================================================================

TOP PRIORITY: MINIMIZE COST while maintaining 100% fulfillment

Cost Reduction Strategies:
1. PREFER SMALL VEHICLES: LightVan over MediumTruck over HeavyTruck
2. MAXIMIZE VEHICLE UTILIZATION: Pack 90%+ capacity per vehicle
3. MINIMIZE VEHICLE COUNT: Consolidate orders aggressively
4. ROUTE OPTIMIZATION: Extended 2-opt with 3-opt local search
5. DISTANCE MINIMIZATION: Nearest-neighbor with savings algorithm
6. FIXED COST AVOIDANCE: Use fewer vehicles even if longer routes

Key Changes from 48:
- Vehicle selection favors smallest viable vehicle (lower fixed cost)
- Aggressive order consolidation (fewer vehicles = lower total fixed cost)
- Extended optimization time (more 2-opt iterations for distance reduction)
- Utilization-based vehicle choice (prefer 85-95% capacity utilization)
