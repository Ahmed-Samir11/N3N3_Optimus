"""
Ne3Na3 Solver 52 - ULTRA-SIMPLE Consolidation for Cost Minimization
======================================================================

EXTREME SIMPLIFICATION:
1. Use ONLY HeavyTrucks (best cost/capacity: $0.17 vs $0.27)
2. Pack ALL orders into MINIMUM number of vehicles
3. Simple nearest-neighbor TSP for routing
4. No ML, no optimization - just CONSOLIDATION

Target: ~$2,700 (2 HeavyTrucks @ $1,200 each + $300 distance)
vs Current: $3,247 (4 vehicles)
